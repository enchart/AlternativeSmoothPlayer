# Alternative Smooth Player
This is a very basic Project Arrhythmia mod that attempts to fix the player visual being capped to 50 FPS due to the way Rigidbody works in Unity.

## Usage
- Press the F key to enable/disable the fix.
- Press the V key to enable/disable the visual representation of the player's physics.
